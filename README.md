# why-T2.1
Welcome! Here you'll find the R scripts with which we carry out the **task T2.1** of the [**WHY** H2020 project](https://www.why-h2020.eu/).

> **NOTE**: The code in this repository is currently under development, so the files and their content may change from one day to the other.

Three main folders can be distinguished:
* ``_scripts``: multipurpose scripts that make use of the ``whyT2.1`` library.
* ``_datasets``: scripts to go from dataset raw files to WHY feature files (former ``DeustoTech/why-datasets`` repository).
* ``_analysis``: scripts to generate the final report from ``clValid`` files.
